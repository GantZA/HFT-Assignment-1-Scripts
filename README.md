# HFT-Assignment-1-Scripts

My workings for the first assignment for High Frequency Trading Analysis, a masters course at UCT.

I still need to clean up and comment better, but the non-numbered files are mostly the final script files.

This assignment was mainly, data extraction, data cleaning and classification and then exploratory data analysis.
